Notes

1. How do we run the code in the project? 
go run <filename> 

2. What does 'package main' mean? 
Package == Project == Workspace (a collection of common source code files)
First line must declare the project or main file declared that it belongs to
In go there are 2 types of packages: 

    executable and reusable 
    
    executable -> go build main.go :: used to do stuff
    
    resuable -> helper functions and stuff like this

if its package main, then it's executable - any other name is a reusable

3. What does 'import "fmt" mean? 
    main-> |fmt| main-> |math| main-> |encoding| 
    golang.org/pkg (to find packages that expand functionality)


4. What's the func thing? 
    func -> declares a function main
    main -> is the name of the function 
    fmt.Println -> tells it to print arg and return new line
    

How is the main.go file organized?
