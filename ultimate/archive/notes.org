#+TITLE: Go Notes 

** Initilization of Variables (labels) 
*** 2 word data structure - pointer and length :: zero value (nil) 
*** var a int (set to zero value) 4 bytes 
*** var b string - 8 Bytes 
*** := 10 productivity operator - initialize and declare at the same time
    
** What is programming? 
*** It starts with a computer 
*** a computer is a tool that can store, retrieve, process and transmit data. 
*** Programming is what people do, to 'teach' a computer how to do this. 
*** Programming languages are a tool to help us do this. 
**** 3 essential parts to a computer:
***** CPU (Central Processing Unit)
****** All processing that a computer does is in the CPU
****** All CPU's use only binary - (on/off)
****** CPU's only work with numbers and only run in Machine Language 
****** Modern pcs have multi-core CPUs, that run concurrently 
***** RAM
****** Giant grid of memory cells
****** Measured in bits, bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes - One byte is "8 bits" a value of 0-255
****** Temporary workspace to hold the data that computers are working on. 
***** Hard Disk
****** Slower, non-volatile storage
****** Measured in bits, bytes, kilobytes, megabytes etc.
****** One byte is "8 bits" a value of 0-255

**** How does processing work? 

***** ram <-> cpu <-> hd

** Variables
*** 3 things to remember
**** declare (name and type) 
**** assign
**** initialize (sign)
